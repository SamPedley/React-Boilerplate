# React + Express Boiler Plate

Just setting this up roughly for now for basic prototyping stuff in the future.

### Getting started with local dev:
1. run ```yarn install``` or ```npm install```
2. run ```npm run dev```
3. visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### NPM Commands:
* ```npm run start``` to build and serve the 'production' version
* ```npm run dev``` to build and serve the app locally at ```localhost:8080``` with all the bells and whistles
* ```npm run test``` to run tests
* ```npm run test:watch``` to watch tests while you work
* ```npm run test:coverage``` to get a coverage report
* ```npm run lint``` to get run the linter
* ```npm run lint:fix``` to fix any small errors

### Project contains:
* [Express 4](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html) for HTTP stuff
* [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) for server dev stuff
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for client side view layer
* [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) for client side data management
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) with friends for client builds and local dev 
* [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) & [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) for client/server testing
* [Standard.js](https://standardjs.com) for linting
* and probably some other stuff I forgot about...
